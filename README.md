## Energy Saved From Recycling Glass, Metal, and Plastic in Singapore (2015-2019)

<p>Did you know that recycling saves energy by reducing or eliminating the need to make materials from scratch? For example, aluminum can manufacturers can skip the energy-costly process of producing aluminum from ore by cleaning and melting recycled cans. Aluminum is classified as a non-ferrous metal.</p>
<p>Singapore has an ambitious goal of becoming a zero-waste nation. The amount of waste disposed of in Singapore has increased seven-fold over the last 40 years. At this rate, Semakau Landfill, Singaporeâ€™s only landfill, will run out of space by 2035. Making matters worse, Singapore has limited land for building new incineration plants or landfills.</p>
<p><b>The government would like to motivate citizens by sharing the total energy that the combined recycling efforts of Glass, Metals, and Plastics have saved every year since 2015. </b> </p>
<p> The data come from different teams, so the names of waste types may differ.</p>
